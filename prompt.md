# Implement these changes:
1. On front-end, replace the text of "Country" data by "City" data of each cards. For example: instead of "Việt Nam" besides the flag of Vietnam, display "Hà Nội".
2. "City" search box should be under dropdown format like "Country".
3. When I click to "view profile", some entries that has some null data points don't show up. Let every entries show modal popup when I click view profile, regardless of that it have null data points or not. 
4. The search box should function simultaneously, when I delete my input, it should show results immediately 
5. When I click "Clear all filters" now, it doesn't reset to the default page and I need to refresh the page. Debug it.
